/*ðŸš— Problem: Vehicle Fuel Efficiency
ðŸ“Œ Problem Description
Design a program to demonstrate polymorphism with method overriding.

Create a base class Vehicle with a method:
fuelEfficiency() â€“ returns generic fuel efficiency
Create subclasses Car, Bike, and Truck that extend Vehicle and override fuelEfficiency() as follows:
Car â†’ returns ""Car Fuel Efficiency: 15 km/l""
Bike â†’ returns ""Bike Fuel Efficiency: 40 km/l""
Truck â†’ returns ""Truck Fuel Efficiency: 8 km/l""
Demonstrate the behavior by creating objects of each subclass and calling
fuelEfficiency().

ðŸ”¹ Input
Create Car, Bike, Truck objects
Call fuelEfficiency() on each

ðŸ”¹ Expected Output
Car Fuel Efficiency: 15 km/l
Bike Fuel Efficiency: 40 km/l
Truck Fuel Efficiency: 8 km/l

ðŸ”¹ Another Test Case
Input:
Vehicle[] vehicles = {new Car(), new Bike(), new Truck()}
for each vehicle call fuelEfficiency()

Output:
Car Fuel Efficiency: 15 km/l
Bike Fuel Efficiency: 40 km/l
Truck Fuel Efficiency: 8 km/l

Examples
Example 1
Input:
Vehicle[] vehicles = {new Car(), new Bike(), new Truck()}
for each vehicle call fuelEfficiency()
Output:
Car Fuel Efficiency: 15 km/l
Bike Fuel Efficiency: 40 km/l
Truck Fuel Efficiency: 8 km/l*/
