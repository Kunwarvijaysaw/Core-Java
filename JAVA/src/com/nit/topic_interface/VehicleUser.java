/*Problem: Vehicle Hybrid Behavior
--------------------------------------
Problem Description
Design a program to demonstrate inheritance and interface implementation
in Java.

Create a base class Vehicle with a method:
showType() â†’ prints ""Generic Vehicle""
Create a subclass Car that extends Vehicle and overrides
showType() â†’ ""Vehicle Type: Car""

Create a subclass Truck that extends Vehicle and implements the interface
ElectricVehicle

Create an interface ElectricVehicle with method
showHybridFeature() â†’ prints ""Hybrid Feature: Electric Assist Enabled""

Demonstrate the behavior by creating objects of Car and Truck and calling
the respective methods.

ðŸ”¹ Input
Create Car object
Create Truck object
Call showType() on both
Call showHybridFeature() on Truck

ðŸ”¹ Expected Output
Car Type: Vehicle Type: Car
Truck Type: Vehicle Type: Truck
Truck Hybrid Feature: Electric Assist Enabled

ðŸ”¹ Another Test Case

Input:
Vehicle[] vehicles = {new Car(), new Truck()}
for each vehicle call showType()
Call showHybridFeature() on Truck


Output:
Vehicle Type: Car
Vehicle Type: Truck
Hybrid Feature: Electric Assist Enabled"
